## camel-undertow

The [camel-undertow](http://camel.apache.org/undertow.html) component provides HTTP-based endpoints for consuming and producing HTTP requests. That is, the [Undertow](http://undertow.io/) component behaves as a simple Web server. Undertow can also be used as a http client which mean you can also use it with Camel as a producer.

The Undertow component integrates with the Undertow server provided by WildFly.
