## Camel Context Deployments

Camel contexts can be deployed to WildFly

1. As a standalone XML file with **-camel-context.xml** suffix
2. As part of another WildFly supported deployment as **META-INF/jboss-camel-context.xml** file

When deployed as XML file, you should see

```

```

When deployed as part of another deployment, you should see something similar
