# Security

Security in WildFly is a broad topic. Both WildFly and camel have well documented, stadardised methods of securing configuration, endpoints and payloads. Camel supports the notion of Camel Context associated Policies, which can be used to integrate with the WildFly security system.

Please also see the security related documentation for these endpoints:

* [JAX-RS Security](jaxrs.md)
* [JAX-WS Security](jaxws.md)
* [JMS Security](jms.md)
