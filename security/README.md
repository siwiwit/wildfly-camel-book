# Security

Security in WildFly is a broad topic. Both WildFly and Camel have well documented, stadardised methods of securing configuration, endpoints and payloads.

For details please see the security related documentation for:

* [JAX-RS Security](jaxrs.md)
* [JAX-WS Security](jaxws.md)
* [JMS Security](jms.md)

In addition to that, we use Camel's notion of Route Policies to integrate with the WildFly security system.

* [RoutePolicy](policy.md)
